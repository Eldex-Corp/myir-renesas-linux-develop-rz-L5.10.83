	tristate "HCI UART driver"
	help
	  Bluetooth HCI UART driver.
	  This driver is required if you want to use Bluetooth devices with
	  serial port interface. You will also need this driver if you have 
	  UART based Bluetooth PCMCIA and CF devices like Xircom Credit Card 
	  adapter and BrainBoxes Bluetooth PC Card.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Bluetooth UART devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (hci_uart).

config BT_HCIUART_RTKH4
	bool "UART (H4) protocol support"
	depends on RTK_HCI_UART 
	help
	  UART (H4) is serial protocol for communication between Bluetooth 
	  device and host. This protocol is required for most Bluetooth devices 
	  with UART interface, including PCMCIA and CF cards. 

	  Say Y here to compile support for HCI UART (H4) protocol.

config BT_HCIUART_RTKH5
	bool "Realtek H5 protocol support"
	depends on RTK_HCI_UART 
	help
	  Realtek H5 is serial protocol for communication 
	  between Realtek Bluetooth device and host. This protocol is required for 
	  Realtek uart h5 bluetooth controller

	  Say Y here to compile support for Realtek HCI H5 protocol.

config BT_HCIUART_LL
	bool "HCILL protocol support"
	depends on BT_HCIUART
	help
	  HCILL (HCI Low Level) is a serial protocol for communication
	  between Bluetooth device and host. This protocol is required for
	  serial Bluetooth devices that are based on Texas Instruments'
	  BRF chips.

	  Say Y here to compile support for HCILL protocol.
